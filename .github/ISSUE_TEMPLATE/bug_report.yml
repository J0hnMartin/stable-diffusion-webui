        Please follow these guidelines when creating an issue:  
        - If possible update to latest version before reporting the issue as older versions cannot be properly supported  
          And search existing **issues** and **discussions** before creating a new one  
        - If issue cannot be clearly seen in the provided log, run SD.Next with debug logging enabled by adding `--debug` to your command line parameters
        - If issue is setup, installation or startup related, please check `sdnext.log` before reporting  
          And if possible, perform reinstallation of required dependencies by running SD.Next with `--reinstall` command line flag  
        - If issue is after recent update of SD.Next, try to reproduce it using clean installation to avoid issues due to old configuration  
        - If you have additional extensions installed, try to reproduce the issue with user extensions disabled  
          And if the issue is with compatibility with specific extension, mark it as such when creating the issue  
          Try running with `--safe` command line flag with disables loading of user-installed extensions  
        - If issue is in functionality marked as *experimental* or relates to *dev* branch, reach out on Discord before creating an issue  
          To see which issues are new/updated/experimental, check [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

        Please perform basic debugging to see if extensions or configuration is the cause of the issue.
        Basic debug procedure
        　1. Disable all third-party extensions - check if extension is the cause
        　2. Update extensions and webui - sometimes things just need to be updated
        　3. Backup and remove your config.json and ui-config.json - check if the issue is caused by bad configuration
        　4. Delete venv with third-party extensions disabled - sometimes extensions might cause wrong libraries to be installed
        　5. Try a fresh installation webui in a different directory - see if a clean installation solves the issue
        Before making a issue report please, check that the issue hasn't been reported recently.
      options:
        - label: The issue exists after disabling all extensions
        - label: The issue exists on a clean installation of webui
        - label: The issue is caused by an extension, but I believe it is caused by a bug in the webui
        - label: The issue exists in the current version of the webui
        - label: The issue has not been reported before recently
        - label: The issue has been reported before but has not been fixed yet
